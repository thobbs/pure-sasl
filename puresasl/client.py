class SASLClient(object):
    """
    A SASL client for one negotiation with a SASL server.

    An new instance of this is typically created when establishing a connection
    with a SASL server. The SASL mechanism may be chosen at creation time or
    set later after a list of server-supported mechanisms has been discovered
    using `:method:choose_mechanism()`.

    Instances of this class do not directly communicate with the server (as
    the communication protocol differs from service to service), but rather
    relies on challenges from the server to be passed in and processed.  When
    initiating a new connection, this is done by passing challenges from the
    server to the :meth:`process()` method until the server indicates that
    SASL negotiation has completed and the `complete` attribute of the instance
    is set to ``True``.

    After the initial negotiation is complete, communication between the
    server and client may need to be processed, depending on the 'quality of
    service', which may call for signatures or encryption. To handle this,
    messages from the server should be passed through :meth:`unwrap()`, and
    messages outbound from the client to server should be passed through
    :meth:`wrap()`.

    Example usage::

        >>> from puresasl.client import SASLClient
        >>>
        >>> sasl = SASLClient('somehost2', 'customprotocol')
        >>> conn = get_connection_to('somehost2')
        >>> available_mechs = conn.get_mechanisms()
        >>> sasl.choose_mechanism(available_mechs, allow_anonymous=False)
        >>> while True:
        ...     status, challenge = conn.get_challenge()
        ...     if status == 'COMPLETE':
        ...         break
        ...     elif status == 'OK':
        ...         response = sasl.process(challenge)
        ...         conn.send_response(response)
        ...     else:
        ...         raise Exception(status)
        ...
        >>> if not sasl.complete:
        ...     raise Exception("SASL negotiation did not complete")
        >>>
        >>> # begin normal communication
        >>> encoded = conn.fetch_data()
        >>> decoded = sasl.unwrap(decoded)
        >>> response = process_data(decoded)
        >>> conn.send_data(sasl.wrap(response))

        `host` is the name of the SASL server, typically an FQDN, and `service` is
        usually the name of the protocol, such as `imap` or `http`.

        `mechanism` may be the string name of a mechanism to use, like
        'PLAIN' or 'GSSAPI'.  If left as ``None``, :meth:`choose_mechanism`
        must be used with a list of mechanisms that the server supports before
        `process()` can be used.

        Optionally, an `authorization_id` may be set if the mechanism and protocol
        support authorization.

        The allowed quality of protection (QoP) choices may be set with the `qops`
        parameter, which should be an iterable of allowed options. Valid options
        include 'auth' for no protection, 'auth-int' for integrity protection,
        and 'auth-conf' for confidentiality protection. The strongest of these
        that the server also supports will be chosen automatically.  If the
        server does not support any of these choices, a
        :exc:`SASLProtocolException` will be raised.

        If the chosen mechanism supports mutual authentication, which is
        authentication of the server by the client, this may be set to
        ``True`` to ensure that mutual authentication is performed.

        A max buffer size may be set with `max_buffer`.  If a max buffer size
        is also set during negotiation by the server, the min of these two
        values will be used.

        Any other mechanism-specific properties may be set with
        `**mechanism_props` and will automatically be passed in to the
        mechanism's constructor.  If any properties are required by the
        mechanism during the course of negotiation have not been passed in
        via `**mechanism_props`, the function passed in here as the `callback`
        argument will be called with one argument, the name of the required
        property.  The `callback` function should return a value for that
        property.
